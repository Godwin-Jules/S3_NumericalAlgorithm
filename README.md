# S3_NumericalAlgorithm
This repository regroup all the algorithm, I wrote during my third semester at EPL in Numerical Algorithm subject. I gather them in this repository. These algorithms are writting especially in python

First of all, we will focusing on the first major part the subject.

## Resolution of type equation f(x) = 0

We have many methods of solving but here, we will deal with four or even five methods of resolution :
* Dichotomy (Bisection) method
* Corde method
* Newton Raphson method
* Substitution (Fixed point) method

### Dichotomy (Bisection) method
* The input :
```
 - the function to verify
 - the limits of the interval [a, b]
 - the precision p (tolerance)
```

* The output :
```
 - the solution interval [a, b]
 - the x tilde value
 - number of iterations
```

### Corde method
* the input :
```
 - the function to verify
 - limits of the interval
 - the precision p (tolerance)
 - number of iterations
```

* the output :
```
 - verification of the convergence
 - the solution interval
 - the x tilde value
 - the number of iterations
```

### Newton Raphson method
* the input :
```
 - the function to verify
 - the derivative the the function to verify
 - the limits of the interval
 - the maximum number of iterations
```

* the output :
```
 - the solution interval
 - the x tilde value
 - the number of iterations
```

### Substitution (Fixed point) method
* the input :
```
 - the function to verify
 - the limits of the interval
 - the precision p (tolerance)
 - the maximum number of iterations
```

* the output :
```
 - the solution interval
 - the x tilde value
 - the number of iterations
```
