# **Resolution of type equation f(x) = 0**

_We have many methods of solving but here, we will deal with four or even five methods of resolution :_
* **Dichotomy (Bisection) method**
* **Corde method**
* **Newton Raphson method**
* **Substitution (Fixed point) method**

## Dichotomy (Bisection) method
* **_The input :_**
```
 - the function to verify
 - the limits of the interval [a, b]
 - the precision p (tolerance)
```

* **_The output :_**
```
 - the solution interval [a, b]
 - the x tilde value
 - number of iterations
```

## **Corde method**
* **_the input :_**
```
 - the function to verify
 - limits of the interval
 - the precision p (tolerance)
 - number of iterations
```

* **_the output :_**
```
 - verification of the convergence
 - the solution interval
 - the x tilde value
 - the number of iterations
```

## **Newton Raphson method**
* **_the input :_**
```
 - the function to verify
 - the derivative the the function to verify
 - the limits of the interval
 - the maximum number of iterations
```

* **_the output :_**
```
 - the solution interval
 - the x tilde value
 - the number of iterations
```

## **Substitution (Fixed point) method**
* **_the input :_**
```
 - the function to verify
 - the limits of the interval
 - the precision p (tolerance)
 - the maximum number of iterations
```

* **_the output :_**
```
